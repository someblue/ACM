Description

There are given n isosceles right triangles on a plane. Each triangle can be described by three integers x,y,m (m>0). 
Vertices of such a triangle are points which have coordinates (x;y), (x+m;y) and (x; y+m).
Write a program which calculates the total area covered by triangles.



输入格式

The first line of the input file tr.in contains one positive integer n (n<=2000), the number of triangles on a plane.
The next n lines of the file describe the triangles, one triangle per line. Each line contains three integers xi, yi and mi,
 separated by single spaces (1<=i<= n,  -10^7<=xi<=10^7,  -10^7<=yi<=10^7, 0 < mi <= 1000).


输出格式

On the first line of the file tr.out one number with exactly one digit after decimal point must be written C the total area 
covered by triangles.
