Description

Adam has a fancy for numbers. Once he found a batch of empty paper cards in his drawer, wrote random numbers on both sides of each 
card and thought of the following puzzle: what smallest possible value can be obtained by putting all cards in an arbitrary order
 (and upturned if necessary) to the expression of the following form:

[] - [] + [] - [] + [] - [] + ... - []

After a while Adam came up with a solution. Could you do that too? Write a program to solve the puzzle described above.



输入格式

The first line contains the number of cards N (2 ≤N ≤100,000, N is an even integer). Each of the following N lines 
contains two integers ai and bi (-2000 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 2000; i = 1…N). These are the numbers written on separate sides of the i-th card.


输出格式

The output file name is CARDS.OUT. The first and the only line should contain the minimal value that can be obtained 
by putting all the cards to the expression as described above.
