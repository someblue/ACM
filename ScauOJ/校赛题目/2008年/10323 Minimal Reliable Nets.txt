Description

College of informatics now decides to build an inner network between the offices. As we all know the reliability of the network 
is important. But since there isn’t too much budget, they decide to build some redundancy into the network while keeping it
 as inexpensive as possible. Specifically, they want to build the cheapest network so that if any one line is broken, all 
offices can still communicate. Let’s just call this a minimal reliable net.
Now you’re in charge of the network design, please write a program to find the minimal reliable net.



输入格式

There will be multiple test cases for this problem. Each test case will start with a pair of integers n (<= 15) and m (<= 20)
 on a line indicating the number of offices (numbered 1 through n) and the number of potential inter-office connections, 
respectively. (Values of n = m = 0 indicate the end of the problem.) The following m lines are of the form b1 b2 c 
(all positive integers) indicating that it costs c to connect office b1 and b2. All connections are bidirectional.


输出格式

For each test case you should print one line giving the cost of a minimal reliable net.
If there is a minimal reliable net, the output line should be of the form:
The minimal cost for test case p is c.
Where p is the number of the test case (starting at 1) and c is the cost. 
If there is no reliable net possible, output a line of the form:
There is no reliable net possible for test case p.
