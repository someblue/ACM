On the no.1 mountain top we can see 2 other mountain tops, which are no.2 and no.6, but cannot see no.3, no.4, and no.5, because they are obstructed by mountain top no.2. On the no.2 mountain top we can see 4. On the no.3 mountain top we can see 1. On the no.4 mountain top we can see 3. On the no.5 mountain top we can see 2. On the no.6 mountain top we can see 2. So the no.2 mountain top is the answer.
