Description

Collision detection(碰撞检测) algorithms are a basic component of 3D and 2D video games. Here is a problem about Collision detection.

There are two tanks in the world. I want you to detect if one tank has hit another.

Assume tanks are 1x1 rectangles in the Cartesian axis and four corners are located on integral point. Now give you every tank’s left-top corner coordinate(x, y), please tell me the collision detection result.
