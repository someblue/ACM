Description

A.D. 1555 , French prophet Nostradamus had predicted that a tough man would born in a poverty family and became the king of France . 1804 , his prediction came true , Napoléon Bonaparte became the king of The First Empire of France . It is all known that Napoleon was defeated in Waterloo . But there was another defeat during his life . At Trafalgar , 1803 , he was defeated by the military of France and England , which was lead by General Horatio Nelson .

During the war , French Army was separated into n teams , numbered from 1 to n . Since the ability of each team leader was different , each team had two damage value ai , bi . ai means the Original-Attack-Value of team i , bi means Support-Attack-Value of team i . If English Army attacked team i , team i+1 would help team i to defence . So if attacked team i it would get a(i-1)*b(i )*min(ai , bi-1) damage . If one team has been attacked , it would be defeated soon . After that , the remaining soldiers would merged with the team which was on the left an next to them . After two teams merged , ai and bi would changed , ai would became original ai of which team in the left side , and bi would became original bi in right side . But there is one important thing , Napoléon was the leader of team 1, so the army could not attacked team 1 , unless there was only one team left . In this situation , it would give a1+ b1 damage . Now , we want to know , what is the minimal damage in total when we destroy French Army ? 


输入格式

The first line is an integer T(<=20) , indicate the number of test cases The first line of each test case , there is an integer n (n<=200) , indicate the number of teams After that there are n lines , each line have two integers ai , bi , indicate the harm value of team i . You can assume the result is fits 32bit integer .


输出格式

For each test case , output one integer indicate the minimal total hurt . The output format please follow sample .

提示

In sample 2 , the situation is as follow : There are 3 teams , a1 = 1 , b1 =2 , a2 = 2 , b2 = 5 , a3 = 1 , b3 = 6 English Army attack team2 , get a1*b2*min(b1,a2)＝1*5*2=10 damage , and then team1 and team2 will merge The damage will become as follow : a1 = 1 . b1 = 5 , a3 = 1 , b3 = 6 (team2 has been defeated) Then attack team3 , get a1*b3*min(b1,a3)=6 damage , and merge team1 and team3 , then a1 = 1 , b1 =6 And then attacked from left side , French Army was destroyed . The minimal total damage is 23 = 10 + 6 + 1 + 6
