Description

Mr. Liu is a famous computer science professor. One day he was prepared to go to some well-known universities to recruit（招募） 
PHD candidate（博士研究生）, and he selected for this particular recruitment from lots of good universities.




It provides that: 
(1) Professor Liu can move from university A to B if there is an edge from A to B.

(2) Professor Liu stays at a university just one day. At evening he must left the university in order to arrive in another university 
next morning. 

(3) Professor Liu can arrive in a university many times. Professor Liu begins his travel from university A (stay a day) and hope 
arrive at university B in the X-th day. To find a suitable route, of course, the first problem is to answer the total number of 
route between A and B. 



输入格式

The first line contains  three 
integers n, m, X (1 <= n, X <= 100), respectively, express the total number of universities, the number of route connectivity, 
as well as how many days would be required to reach the University of B from A. 
Then there is m lines, each line a pair of integers x, y (1 <= x, y <= n), means Professor Liu can be from university x to y 
directly. (Note: 所有边都是有向边)
The next line contains an integer q (1 <= q <= 100), then you should work out q answers. Then Q line follows, each line has 
two integers A and B (1 <= A, B <= n), namely A, B University. 


输出格式

Output file contains q lines, and each line has an integer t, for the demand for the total route number from University A to B 
to meet the above requirements. Input data for solving the problem is the total number of lines does not exceed the scope of a 
long integer, that is, t <2 ^ 31.
