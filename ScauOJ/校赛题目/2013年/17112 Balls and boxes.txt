Description

You are given N boxes and N balls, N <= 40. Each box and each ball is colored, there are
a_i boxes of color i and b_j balls of color j, sum(a_i)=sum(b_j)=N. Two boxes
or two ball of same color are indistinguishable.

Your task is to calculate how many distinct ways are there to place in every box
exactly one ball. Two ways are considered same if it is possible to permute
boxes with balls inside to get one from another.



输入格式

You have to solve T <= 50 test cases, where each test case consists of the following:
the first line contains number u, number of colors of boxes. Next line contains
u space-separated numbers: a_i, number of boxes of i-th color. Next to lines
contains v and v numbers b_j - number of balls of j-th color.


输出格式

Output one single line with the number of ways to place balls in boxes.
The answer may be very big, so we are interested in the result % 10^9 + 7.
