Description

You are one of the Harlie employees, the owner two chocolate factories, two of
the biggest chocolates factories in the world, so feel lucky to be his employee
in this task. He also like programming and maths (oh look, you have something
in common). One day he was thinking about life and stuff and came up with the
following task and he is challenging you to solve it (maybe if you do it right,
you will get a promotion).

Each factory sells boxes of chocolates of size 1 x N. Also, you have M
different types of chocolates and inifinite chocolates of each type. The size
of the ith type of chocolate is 1 x Li. Now, you are wondering in how many ways
can you fill the box of chocolates. One way is different than the other if the
number of chocolates used is different, the number of chocolates of some type
is different or if the positions of the chocolates are different. For more
information please go to the first test case explanation.

Also each factory has certain restrictions you should know:
* First factory restrictions:
 - The maximum size of the chocolate box is 10 ** 9.
 - They have 0 < M <= 20 different types of chocolates.
 - The size of each type of chocolate is 0 < Li <= 20.
* Second factory restrictions:
 - The maximum size of the chocolate box is 10 ** 3.
 - They have 0 < M <= 10 ** 3 different types of chocolates.
 - The size of each type of chocolate is 0 < Li <= 10 ** 3.



输入格式

You have to solve T test cases, where each test case consists of the following:
the first line contains 2 number, N (the size of the chocolate box) and M (the
number of different types of chocolates). After that, one line follows with M
space-separated integers L1 L2 ... LM (the sizes of the types of chocolates).
Each data set match at least one of the factories restrictions.


输出格式

Output one single line with the number of ways to fill the box of chocolates
with the M types of chocolates at your disposal. The answer may be very big,
so we are interested in the result % 10 ** 9 + 7.
