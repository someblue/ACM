Description

Let us define a Farjuli sequence in the following way:
If a sequence of n integers P[1]... P[i]... P[n], which satisfied p[i + 1] % n = (p [i] + 1) % n, (1 < = i < n), we say this sequence is a Farjuli sequence.
After some research, Yuan find an interesting way to play with the sequence: by swapping adjacent numbers, he wants to make the original sequence become a farjuli sequence.
In particular, for some reason, Yuan don't like the number 1 appears in some specific places. For example, if Yuan don't want that the number 1 appears in the second position, then the sequence (n 1 2 3.... n-1) is not a farjuli sequence which Yuan likes.
Now, Yuan wonder what is the minimum number of swap to make the sequence into a farjuli  sequence which Yuan likes?



输入格式

Line 1: contains two number n and m. (n<=100000)
n is the number of integers in the sequence and m means the number of position where Yuan don't like the number 1 appears. 
Line 2: contains n different integers between 1 and n.
Line 3: contains m different integers between 1 and n.(Be sure m<n)
The end of input is indicated by a line in which n=m = -1.


输出格式

The output should contain the minimum number of swap, one per line.
