Description



Can you find the rule of these equations?
Let me explain for you. There are only 3 definitions:
Every Tree represent a prime integer (prime integer is an integer that can only divide by 1 and itself. e.g. 2,3,5,7 etc.).
A forest (one or more trees) represents a integer which is the product of trees.
If we add a root for a forest (Let n to be the integer it represent) to build a tree, then this new tree represent the n-th prime integer.
For example , 2 is the first prime integer , we use one node to represent it , and 3 is the second , so we add a root to 2 , it become 3. 
Then add a root to 3 , we get the third prime ――5. If we add a root to 5? We get the fifth prime, which is 11. Also, while combine 3 and 5 ,
 we will get 15 since 15=3*5 . That is why 11 and 15 represent that in the figure.


Figure 2: 15=3*5 and 23 is the 9-th prime integer.
Now, give you a tree, can you find the integer it represents?



输入格式

The Input will contain multiple cases.
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then T cases follow.
The first line of each case, is a integer n(n>0) , that represents the number of nodes in the forest.
After that, there will be one line contains n integers. The i-th integer ai means that the father node of 
the i-th node is ai (0<=ai<=n) . And if ai=0, it just means that i-th node is a root of tree (0 is not a node).
You can assume that all this can exactly build a forest, and cases like:
2
2 1
is invalid and will not appear.


输出格式

For each case, output the answer in one line.
You may assume that all the answers are less than 50000.
