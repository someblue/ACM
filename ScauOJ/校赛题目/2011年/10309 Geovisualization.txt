Description

As a GIS programmer, PKKJ is writing a program to display a map the screen. As you know, the features in the map, 
such as highways, rivers and pipeline, consist of a great amount of segments. A segment is a straight line from 
Point A(x1, y1) to Point B(x2, y2). When display these segments, each of them should be clipped into the screen.
 That means the part which is located out of the screen should be deleted. A screen can be regard as a rectangle.
 For example, in the illustration below, the rectangle represents the boundary of the screen. Segment AB in should 
be cut into BC before being drawn to the screen.



Now give you the coordinates of the both ends of a segment, you should cut this segment to fit the extent of the 
screen and output the coordinates of the result segment. To simplify this problem, you can assume that the left-bottom 
coordinate of the screen is always (0, 0) and the right-top is (30, 20). What's more, to make this problem easier,
 all the segment are horizontal(y1 = y2, x1≠x2) or vertical(x1 = x2, y1≠y2).



输入格式

Each input file contains only one test case with four integers representing the ends of one segment:
x1 y1 x2 y2
(x1, y1) is the one point and (x2, y2) is another point. It is guarantee that -100 <= x1, x2, y1, y2 <= 100, 
and no segment will overlap with the boundary of screen. Segments like (0, 0)-(0, 10) will not appear.


输出格式

You should output the coordinates of the result segment. 
x1 y1 x2 y2
You should output the left point or bottom point first and then the right or upper point. If all part of the segment 
is outside the screen, you should output “none”.


输入样例

-100 -100 -100 -99


输出样例

none


提示

Here is another sample:
Input:  -5 5 5 5
Output:  0 5 5 5
