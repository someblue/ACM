Description

There are 26^n strings with length n containing only uppercase letters.
	A m-nondecreasing substring is a substring with length m,and all its letters are nondecreasing.
	For example , when m = 2 , “AA”, “AC” are nondecreasing, but “WA” is not.
	Now comes the question: among all the 26n strings, how many strings contain at least k m-nondecreasing substring.
	For example, when n = 6 , m = 2, k = 3 ,string “STOOYY”has 4 m-nondecreasing substrings, namely“ST”,
 “OO”, “OY”, “YY”, which satisfies the constraint.



输入格式

Multiples test cases (about 130), proceed to the end of file.
	Each line contains only 3 numbers: n m k. (1<m≤n≤11 , 0≤k≤11)


输出格式

For each test case, output the number of strings which satisfies the constraint.
	Please Use 64bit Integer to represent the answer.

提示

In case 2, there are 3 conditions:
① The first two letters are nondecreasing while the last letter is arbitrary, like “AB*”.
② The second and third letters are nondecreasing while the first letter is arbitrary, like “*AB”.
③ All the letters are nondecreasing , like “ABC”.
So the answer will be ①+②-③ , since the strings which satisfy ③ will satisfy ① and ② , ③ has been count twice in ①+②.
