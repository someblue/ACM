Description

There is a curve (f(x)) in the rectangular coordinates (Figure 1). We want to know how much area among the four lines 
(the curve f(x) and three straight lines x=X1, x=X2, y=0). 




Figure 1.  The rectangular coordinates
The function f(x) is defined as followed:



(1)
For example, if X1=1 and X2=2, it is our task to compute the areas of black region.




Figure 2. the areas of black region



输入格式

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1 < T <= 1000). Each test case is in the following format.
Every line has one test case and each test case contains 2 real numbers: X1, and X2 ( ). 


输出格式

For each test case, your program must output the approximate value (rounding-off method) of area. We request keep 4 
decimal places. For example, if the area is 0.1234506789…, please output the approximate value 0.1235; if the area
 is 0.1234499999…, please output the approximate value 0.1234.

提示



If you don't know how to output a approximate, just printf(“%.4f\n”,answer);.
We strongly recommended you to choose a proper value of n. Too big will get Time Limit Exceed And too small will 
get Wrong Answer in this problem.
