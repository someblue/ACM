Description

Mike was going to escape from the prison when he knew how to do it. However, many other people realized his secret and asked him for help. But, 
to avoid being caught by guards, Mike could only take one people with him. By thinking for a minute, an idea came out in his mind to choose one 
from all the people who wanted to break the prison:
Let all the n people (assuming they are numbered from 0 to n-1) gather together in a circle and play a game, the one who wins in the end might 
have a chance to escape with Mike.
Here is the rule of the game: 
Select two people adjacent to each other in the circle randomly, and then they might fight between each other. The loser in the fight has to quit 
the game and the winner can stay. Repeat this step until there is only one person left and this person can go with Mike.  
As Mike was a clever man (even though not so careful for letting others know his plan), he knew exactly who will win between i and j before the 
two people fight each other, and he draw a n*n matrix G in which G(i,j)=1 means i can win j during the game, while G(i,j)=0 in opposite. And now, 
Mike would like to know the list of the people who cannot escape with him no matter in which order the fights are arranged, can you help him?



输入格式

The first line of the input is an integer T indicating the number of the case, and in each case, the first line of the case is an integer n 
indicating the number of people. Then a n*n matrix G follows whose meaning has been shown above. (1 <= n <= 100)


输出格式

You should output the numbers of the people who might not have a chance to escape in any situations. These numbers should be printed out in 
ascending order and there is only one number in each line. If everyone might have a chance to escape, print out “none” instead.

Let us see this sample: 
Since 0 can beat 3, 3 beats 1 and 1 beats 2, so 0 can win the game to escape. It is also easy to find that prisoner 1, 2, 3 might have the chance to win the game. So the output is “none”.
