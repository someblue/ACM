Description

There is a straight highway with villages alongside the highway. The highway is represented as an integer axis, and the position 
of each village is identified with a single integer coordinate. There are no two villages in the same position. The distance between 
two positions is the absolute value of the difference of their integer coordinates. 

Post offices will be built in some, but not necessarily all of the villages. A village and the post office in it have the same position.
For building the post offices, their positions should be chosen so that the total sum of all distances between each village and its 
nearest post office is minimum. But there is another rule that for each village the nearest post office to it shouldn't exceed the 
distance of demand. Further more, the distance of demand for each village is different.

You are to write a program which, given the positions of the villages, the distance of each village's demand and the number of post 
offices, computes the least possible sum of all distances between each village and its nearest post office. 



输入格式

Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains two integers: the first is the number of villages V, 1 <= V <= 300,
 and the second is the number of post offices P, 1 <= P <= 30, P <= V. The second line contains V integers in increasing order. These V 
integers are the positions of the villages. For each position X it holds that 1 <= X <= 10000. The third line contains V integers. 
These V integers are the distance of demand. For each distance Y it holds that 1 <= Y <= 10000.


输出格式

The first line contains one integer S, which is the sum of all distances between each village and its nearest post office. 
If can't build post offices to satisfy the demand of all villages, output -1.

提示

The five coordinates of the post offices are 6, 7, 9, 22, 50. The total sum of all distances is 20.
