Description

There are n distinct points in the plane, given by their integer coordinates. Find the number of parallelograms whose vertices 
lie on these points. In other words, find the number of 4-element subsets of these points that can be written as {A, B, C, D} 
such that AB || CD, and BC || AD. You may assume that No four points are in a straight line.



输入格式

The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 1000). Each of the next n lines, contains 2 space-separated integers x and y 
(the coordinates of a point) with magnitude (absolute value) of no more than 1000000000.


输出格式

Output the number of the parallelograms as described above.
