Description

A fractal（分形） is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. 
The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same "type" of structures must appear on all scales.
A box fractal is defined as below :
?	A box fractal of degree 1 is simply 
?	X
?	A box fractal of degree 2 is 
?	X X
?	 X
?	X X
?	If using B(n - 1) to represent the box fractal of degree n - 1, then a box fractal of degree n is defined recursively as 
following 
?	B(n - 1)          B(n - 1)
?	         B(n - 1)
?	B(n - 1)          B(n - 1)
Your task is to draw a box fractal of degree n.



输入格式

The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains a positive integer n which is no greater than 7. The last 
line of input is a negative integer -1 indicating the end of input.


输出格式

For each test case, output the box fractal using the 'X' notation. Please notice that 'X' is an uppercase letter. Print a line 
with only a single dash after each test case. Don't output any trailing spaces at the end of each line, or you may get an 'Wrong Answer'!
